This website was created with the purpose of sharing knowledge and experiences about homelab. Essentially a personal blog, where you will find how-to guides, resources, and cost breakdowns. Initially focused on homelab topics such as infrastructure, servers, Kubernetes, domains, Linux, Windows, MacOS, and much more.
